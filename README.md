## Evaluation on the small and medium-sized datasets
For evaluation on the small and medium-sized datasets without the partition strategies, unpackage data.zip, and directly run run.sh. Note to switch the dataset option in run.sh. You can also select the alignment inference strategies from “dalign”, “ralign”, “ralign-wr”, “ralign-pb”. Credit to the [RREA repo](https://github.com/MaoXinn/RREA). 

Required packages can be found in requirement.txt. 

## Evaluation on the large-scale datasets
For evaluation on the large-scale dataset, open the Large-scale directory. 
Unpackage the DBP15K.zip, DWY100K.zip.
The size of the FB_DBP_2M dataset is too large. You can download it [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ar-uYoG1mfiLkx97L7j4MrVUMazO?e=8SSjgt) and put the unzipped files under this directory. 
Then, run run.py to obtain the results.
